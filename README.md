Created a web server using the Express.js framework and added it to a front-end application that a local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The siteâ€™s data will live on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I deployed my application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
